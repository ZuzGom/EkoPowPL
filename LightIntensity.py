Amount of light reflected from Earth (intensity in lux), depending on air pollution
https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics

Luminance is a photometric measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction.
It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted from, or is reflected from a particular area,
and falls within a given solid angle.
reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance

Relative luminance follows the photometric definition of luminance, but with the
values normalized to 1 or 100 for a reference white. Like the photometric definition,
it is related to the luminous flux density in a particular direction, which is radiant flux density
weighted by the luminosity function y(Î») of the CIE Standard Observer.
Y = 0.2126*R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B.
